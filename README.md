HOW TO USE
----------

## Perparing

1. change to module_certification_tools directory

2. execute build.sh to load composer.phar
> hostname:module_certification_tool$ ./lib/oxmd/build.sh

3. run composer to install dependencies
> hostname:module_certification_tool$ php composer.phar install

4. edit config.cfg
 * define location of module path
 * define location of clover.xml file generated by phpunit. If this is empty, the tool will try to execute the unit tests and generate its own clover.xml file
 * the CFG_DELETE_OLD_RUNS flag defines, if results from older runs are deleted or not. If NO is set, keep in mind, that each run will add a new result directory

5. Execute the run.sh script
> hostname:module_certification_tool$ ./run.sh
 * When starting with -d option, CFG_DELETE_OLD_RUNS from config.cfg is ignored and all old results will be deleted
